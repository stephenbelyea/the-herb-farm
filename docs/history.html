            <h2>humble beginnings</h2>
            <p>
              The Herb Farm first made a catalogue available in 1982. Nurtured
              into a business by Joyce Belyea and Clint Wiezel, the little
              10-acre farm in Norton soon met with recognition, respect, and a
              wide base of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike today, herb farming at the time was a very
              rarely-considered commercial possibility – but The Herb Farm
              quickly proved that a wide and sustainable market was simply lying
              in wait. Their well-rounded catalogue soon offered naturally grown
              herbs to customers all over North America – including a regular
              supply a major grocery chain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of The Herb Farm’s success and expertise, Joyce and Clint
              were regularly featured on radio and television by CBC, as well as
              Canadian agricultural publications.
            </p>
            <h2>a fresh crop</h2>
            <p>
              By the late 1990’s, after Clint Wiezel had passed away, Joyce
              Belyea gradually stepped back from the once-booming Herb Farm. She
              eventually shut down commercial business in 1998 and divided the
              land between her four children.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2000, Joyce’s son David, and his wife Angela, officially bought
              the remaining three shares of the 10-acre property. Joyce
              transferred the company to Angela not long after, and The Herb
              Farm was soon restarted.
            </p>
            <h2>healthy growth</h2>
            <p>
              Under Angela Belyea’s initiative, The Herb Farm was first
              registered Organic in 2004. Originally, Joyce and Clint had
              maintained a chemical-free business for low environmental impact,
              but had not sought certification. With a current track-record of
              Organic Certification, The Herb Farm is now able to deliver
              absolutely pure, natural goods – whether it is herbs, fruits,
              vegetables or home grown fiber-arts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only the finest soils and fertilizers are spread, planted, tended
              and harvested by hand for an outstanding healthy, natural product.
